## How It Works

1. Size Limit contains a CLI tool, 3 plugins (`file`, `webpack`, `time`)
   and 3 plugin presets for popular use cases (`app`, `big-lib`, `small-lib`).
   A CLI tool finds plugins in `package.json` and loads the config.
2. If you use the `webpack` plugin, Size Limit will bundle your JS files into
   a single file. It is important to track dependencies andÂ webpack polyfills.
   It is also useful for small libraries with many small files and without
   a bundler.
3. The `webpack` plugin creates an empty webpack project, adds your library
   and looks for the bundle size difference.
4. The `time` plugin compares the current machine performance with that of
   a low-priced Android devices to calculate the CPU throttling rate.
5. Then the `time` plugin runs headless Chrome (or desktop Chrome if itâ€™s
   available) toÂ track the time a browser takes toÂ compile and execute your JS.
   Note that these measurements depend on available resources and might
   be unstable. [See here](https://github.com/mbalabash/estimo/issues/5)
   for more details.


## Usage

### JS Applications

Suitable for applications that have their own bundler and send the JS bundle
directly to a client (without publishing it to npm). Think of a user-facing app
or website, like an email client, a CRM, a landing page or a blog with
interactive elements, using React/Vue/Svelte lib or vanilla JS.

<details><summary><b>Show instructions</b></summary>

1. Install the preset:

    ```sh
    npm install --save-dev size-limit @size-limit/file
    ```

2. Add the `size-limit` section and the `size` script to your `package.json`:

    ```diff
    + "size-limit": [
    +   {
    +     "path": "dist/app-*.js"
    +   }
    + ],
      "scripts": {
        "build": "webpack ./webpack.config.js",
    +   "size": "npm run build && size-limit",
        "test": "jest && eslint ."
      }
    ```

3. Hereâ€™s how you can get the size for your current project:

    ```sh
    $ npm run size

      Package size: 30.08 kB with all dependencies, minified and gzipped
    ```

4. Now, letâ€™s set the limit. Add 25% to the current total size and use that as
   the limit in your `package.json`:

    ```diff
      "size-limit": [
        {
    +     "limit": "35 kB",
          "path": "dist/app-*.js"
        }
      ],
    ```

5. Add the `size` script to your test suite:

    ```diff
      "scripts": {
        "build": "webpack ./webpack.config.js",
        "size": "npm run build && size-limit",
    -   "test": "jest && eslint ."
    +   "test": "jest && eslint . && npm run size"
      }
    ```

6. If you donâ€™t have a continuous integration service running, donâ€™t forget
   to add one â€”Â start with [Travis CI].

### JS Application and Time-based Limit

File size limit (in kB) is not the best way to describe your JS application
cost for developers. Developers will compare the size of the JS bundle
with the size of images. But browsers need much more time to parse 100 kB
of JS than 100 kB of an image since JS compilers are very complex.

This is why Size Limit support time-based limit. It runs headless Chrome
to track the time a browser takes to compile and execute your JS.

<details><summary><b>Show instructions</b></summary>

1. Install the preset:

    ```sh
    npm install --save-dev size-limit @size-limit/preset-app
    ```

2. Add the `size-limit` section and the `size` script to your `package.json`:

    ```diff
    + "size-limit": [
    +   {
    +     "path": "dist/app-*.js"
    +   }
    + ],
      "scripts": {
        "build": "webpack ./webpack.config.js",
    +   "size": "npm run build && size-limit",
        "test": "jest && eslint ."
      }
    ```

3. Hereâ€™s how you can get the size for your current project:

    ```sh
    $ npm run size

      Package size: 30.08 kB with all dependencies, minified and gzipped
      Loading time: 602 ms   on slow 3G
      Running time: 214 ms   on Snapdragon 410
      Total time:   815 ms
    ```

4. Now, letâ€™s set the limit. Add 25% to the current total time and use that as
   the limit in your `package.json`:

    ```diff
      "size-limit": [
        {
    +     "limit": "1 s",
          "path": "dist/app-*.js"
        }
      ],
    ```

5. Add the `size` script to your test suite:

    ```diff
      "scripts": {
        "build": "webpack ./webpack.config.js",
        "size": "npm run build && size-limit",
    -   "test": "jest && eslint ."
    +   "test": "jest && eslint . && npm run size"
      }
    ```

6. If you donâ€™t have a continuous integration service running, donâ€™t forget
   to add one â€”Â start with [Travis CI].

### Big Libraries

JS libraries > 10 kB in size.

This preset includes headless Chrome, and will measure your libâ€™s execution
time. You likely donâ€™t need this overhead for a small 2 kB lib, but for larger
ones the execution time is a more accurate and understandable metric that
the size in bytes. Libraries like [React] are good examples for this preset.

<details><summary><b>Show instructions</b></summary>

1. Install preset:

    ```sh
    npm install --save-dev size-limit @size-limit/preset-big-lib
    ```

2. Add the `size-limit` section and the `size` script to your `package.json`:

    ```diff
    + "size-limit": [
    +   {
    +     "path": "dist/react.production-*.js"
    +   }
    + ],
      "scripts": {
        "build": "webpack ./scripts/rollup/build.js",
    +   "size": "npm run build && size-limit",
        "test": "jest && eslint ."
      }
    ```

3. If you use ES modules you can test the size after tree-shaking with `import`
   option:

    ```diff
      "size-limit": [
        {
          "path": "dist/react.production-*.js",
    +     "import": "{ createComponent }"
        }
      ],
    ```

4. Hereâ€™s how you can get the size for your current project:

    ```sh
    $ npm run size

      Package size: 30.08 kB with all dependencies, minified and gzipped
      Loading time: 602 ms   on slow 3G
      Running time: 214 ms   on Snapdragon 410
      Total time:   815 ms
    ```

5. Now, letâ€™s set the limit. Add 25% to the current total time and use that
   as the limit in your `package.json`:

    ```diff
      "size-limit": [
        {
    +     "limit": "1 s",
          "path": "dist/react.production-*.js"
        }
      ],
    ```

6. Add a `size` script to your test suite:

    ```diff
      "scripts": {
        "build": "rollup ./scripts/rollup/build.js",
        "size": "npm run build && size-limit",
    -   "test": "jest && eslint ."
    +   "test": "jest && eslint . && npm run size"
      }
    ```

7. If you donâ€™t have a continuous integration service running, donâ€™t forget
   to add one â€”Â start with [Travis CI].
8. Add the library size to docs, it will help users to choose your project:

    ```diff
      # Project Name

      Short project description

      * **Fast.** 10% faster than competitor.
    + * **Small.** 15 kB (minified and gzipped).
    +   [Size Limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) controls the size.
    ```

</details>


### Small Libraries

JS libraries < 10 kB in size.

This preset will only measure the size, without the execution time, so itâ€™s
suitable for small libraries. If your library is larger, you likely want
the Big Libraries preset above. [NanoÂ ID]Â orÂ [Storeon]Â areÂ goodÂ examples
for this preset.

<details><summary><b>Show instructions</b></summary>

1. First, install `size-limit`:

    ```sh
    npm install --save-dev size-limit @size-limit/preset-small-lib
    ```

2. Add the `size-limit` section and the `size` script to your `package.json`:

    ```diff
    + "size-limit": [
    +   {
    +     "path": "index.js"
    +   }
    + ],
      "scripts": {
    +   "size": "size-limit",
        "test": "jest && eslint ."
      }
    ```

3. Hereâ€™s how you can get the size for your current project:

    ```sh
    $ npm run size

      Package size: 177 B with all dependencies, minified and gzipped
    ```

4. If your project size starts to look bloated, run `--why` for analysis:

    ```sh
    npm run size -- --why
    ```

    > We use [Statoscope](https://github.com/statoscope/statoscope) as bundle analyzer.

5. Now, letâ€™s set the limit. Determine the current size of your library,
   add just a little bit (a kilobyte, maybe) andÂ useÂ thatÂ asÂ theÂ limit
   in your `package.json`:

    ```diff
     "size-limit": [
        {
    +     "limit": "9 kB",
          "path": "index.js"
        }
     ],
    ```

6. Add the `size` script to your test suite:

    ```diff
      "scripts": {
        "size": "size-limit",
    -   "test": "jest && eslint ."
    +   "test": "jest && eslint . && npm run size"
      }
    ```

7. If you donâ€™t have a continuous integration service running, donâ€™t forget
   to add one â€”Â start with [Travis CI].
8. Add the library size to docs, it will help users to choose your project:

    ```diff
      # Project Name

      Short project description

      * **Fast.** 10% faster than competitor.
    + * **Small.** 500 bytes (minified and gzipped). NoÂ dependencies.
    +   [Size Limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) controls the size.
    ```

## Config

### Plugins and Presets

Plugins or plugin presets will be loaded automatically from `package.json`.
For example, if you want to use `@size-limit/webpack`, you can just use
`npm install --save-dev @size-limit/webpack`, or you can use our preset
`@size-limit/preset-big-lib`.

Plugins:

* `@size-limit/file` checks the size of files with Gzip, Brotli
  or without compression.
* `@size-limit/webpack` adds your library to empty webpack project
  and prepares bundle file for `file` plugin.
* `@size-limit/webpack-why` adds reports for `webpack` plugin
  about your library is of this size to show the cost of all your
  dependencies.
* `@size-limit/webpack-css` adds css support for `webpack` plugin.
* `@size-limit/esbuild` is like `webpack` plugin, but uses `esbuild`
  to be faster and use less space in `node_modules`.
* `@size-limit/esbuild-why` add reports for `esbuild` plugin
  about your library is of this size to show the cost of all your
  dependencies.
* `@size-limit/time` uses headless Chrome to track time to execute JS.
* `@size-limit/dual-publish` compiles files to ES modules with [`dual-publish`]
  to check size after tree-shaking.

Plugin presets:

* `@size-limit/preset-app` contains `file` and `time` plugins.
* `@size-limit/preset-big-lib` contains `webpack`, `file`, and `time` plugins.
* `@size-limit/preset-small-lib` contains `esbuild` and `file` plugins.
