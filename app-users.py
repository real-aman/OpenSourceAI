             should summarize for me. I will give you a maximum and a minimum
             amount of words you should use for the text. I am also going
             to give you the text itself after that. The language
             of the text you get should define in which language
             you write the summary. For Example, if the text is German
             the summary should be in German too. This goes for every language.
             While writing the summary I want you to remember the following information:
             When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial,'perplexity' and 'burstiness'
             ,Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares
             the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with great burstiness,
             for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter sentences.
             AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content
             I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity
             and burstiness. Keep that information in mind while writing. Minimum: 100, Maximum: 500, Text: """ + blogPost}
